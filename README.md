## About Linux Audio Pop Fix

This is a quick walkthrough to hopefully help someone if their Linux OS audio pops and crackles when starting, or adjusting, the volume of any audio. Aparently the mishap is from the audio server called "Pulse Audio".

It basically goes to sleep when audio is inactive. So when you start or turn up any audio, a static-ish pop and/or crackle happens very briefly, like a half second long when Pulse "wakes up".
